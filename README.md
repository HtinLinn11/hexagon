# Automated Ticket Response System for a University (AI-Driven Response Generation)

## Overview
The **Automated Ticket Response System** leverages advanced AI, specifically Google's **Gemini API**, to generate automated ticket responses. This system processes opened tickets, analyzes their content, and generates relevant replies using natural language processing (NLP) capabilities. The system ensures a seamless blend of AI-generated responses and human oversight for quality control, improving efficiency in customer service operations.

## Features
- **Automated Responses**: Generate AI-driven replies to opened tickets.
- **AI Integration**: Powered by Google’s Gemini API for natural language processing.
- **Customer Service Oversight**: Human customer service representatives can review and refine AI-generated responses for accuracy and quality.
- **Database Management**: Stores email records and responses for future analysis and auditing.
- **User Interface**: Provides an intuitive interface for users to interact with the system.
- **System Scalability**: Built on **Django** and hosted on **Render.com** for scalability and robust performance.

## System Architecture
The system is designed with several key components:

- **User Interface (UI)**: Allows users to compose and open tickets, triggering the response generation process.
- **GPT API Engine**: Analyzes opened tickets using Google’s Gemini API and generates a response.
- **Database**: Stores both original emails and AI-generated responses for reference and analysis.

### System Workflow
1. **User opens a ticket**: The user interacts with the UI to send a ticket.
2. **AI generates response**: The email content is forwarded to the GPT API for processing.
3. **Customer service review**: A human representative reviews and approves or refines the response.
4. **Email sent**: Once approved, the response is sent to the user and stored in the database for record-keeping.

## Technologies Used
- **Google Gemini API**: Powers the AI-driven response generation.
- **Django**: Used for backend development and managing user interactions.
- **Python**: Chosen for backend logic and API integrations.
- **HTML, CSS, JavaScript**: Used for frontend development and interface design.
- **PostgreSQL**: Database management system for storing email data.
- **Render.com**: Cloud hosting platform for deploying the application.
- **Gunicorn & Uvicorn**: Used for application deployment in a production environment.
- **GitHub**: Version control and collaboration.
